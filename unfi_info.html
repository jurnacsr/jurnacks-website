Jurnack’s, Naturally!, Inc. is pleased to offer a unique program which allows consumers to purchase grocery, 
bulk foods, supplements, and personal care products near wholesale prices.  
This program is offered through United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI), the largest natural foods distributor in the nation.  
Below are the details of this exciting program:

<ul>
<li>Orders are due Mondays by 11 AM.  You may either drop off, Fax, email or mail your order.  </li>
<li>Please do not phone in your order unless it is only a few items.</li>
<li>Orders are delivered on Tuesdays.  We do request orders be picked up on Tuesday but if that is not possible just let us know.</li>
<li>When making out your order, please list Item number, Quantity, Item Name and Price.  It is not necessary to total the order.</li>
<li>There is NO minimum order and payment is due when you pick up your order.</li>
<li>When ordering an item using the catalog, please ensure there is a “Y” in the warehouse column OR the warehouse column is blank for that item.  
When the column is blank it means the item is available in all the UNFI warehouses.</li>
<li>If an item is out of stock it will automatically be reordered for the next 2 weeks unless we are advised otherwise.</li>
<li>There is a $20 sign-up fee and no yearly renewal fee as long as a buying club order is placed within the 12 months following sign-up.  </li>
<li>Catalogs are available on-line free of charge.  The procedure to view them is below.</li>
</ul>

Viewing Items and the Buying Club Catalog Online:
<ol>
<li>Go to www.unfi.com</li>
<li>Make sure the box about half way down the page on the right of the screen is selected to “UNFI East Region” and the little circle in front of “Customer” is highlighted.  Hit the orange “Login” button.   In the “User name” box type york and in the “Password”  box type BuyingClub12. Press enter.  BuyingClub12 is case sensitive.</li>
<li>You are now at the York warehouse home page.  At this point you can search using the criteria listed on the top left of the page (“SEARCH PRODUCTS by brand or description”).  If you want to search using the Product Number you found in the catalog, the number must be inputted in the "search" area the following way - XXXXXXX.  The product number must be seven digits long with no dash before the last digit.  If the number from the catalog is only 6 digits, please place a 0 (zero) as the first digit.</li>
<li>When the desired product number and/or product description has been found, put your cursor over the product number, which should be underlined, and select it.  This page will give you ingredient info, nutritional content, gluten-free info, etc.  If a camera icon is listed next to the product number on the prior page, there should be a picture of the product.</li>
<li>Buying Club catalogs are available for viewing when you are on the home page of the York warehouse just after logging in.  At the top left of the screen there is an icon, below the UNFI logo, for Buying Club Catalogs with a little orange triangle just in front.   Selecting this icon will display links for viewing several month’s worth of catalogs.  Clicking the link "(month/year) Full Product List Excel" will download the whole catalog with regularly priced and sale priced products.  Since this contains ALL products available in every warehouse it is VERY important to make sure there is a "Y" in the WRHS (warehouse) column if you want to order it.  If a product is on sale for that period there will be a number listed in the % off column.  The only drawback with using this method is that no ingredients or descriptions are offered here.  However, pricing is.  </li>
