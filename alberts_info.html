<h3>Jurnack’s, Naturally!, Inc Buying Club-Albert’s Organics</h3>
</center>
Jurnack’s, Naturally!, Inc is pleased to offer a buying club which allows members to purchase fresh, organic produce at near wholesale prices.  This program is offered through UNFI and Albert’s Organics.
Below are the details of this program:
<ul>
<li>There is a $20 sign-up fee and no yearly renewal fee as long as a buying club order is placed within the 12 months following sign-up.  This sign-up fee also covers your membership into our UNFI buying club.</li>
<li>We anticipate placing orders approximately every 3 weeks.</li>
<li>A price list will be e-mailed to you as well as posted on our Facebook group page “Jurnack’s, Naturally!, Inc. Buying Club”</li>
<li>Place your wish list by going to www.coop.jurnacks.com and following the directions there.</li>
<li>You do not have to order a whole case of anything and there is no minimum price total you have to meet.  </li>
<li>Orders are to be picked up the day it is delivered to Jurnack’s, Naturally!, Inc. 	as we don’t have the space to store fresh produce.</li>
<li>Payment is due upon pick up by cash or check only.  We request this due to all the fees incurred when doing credit or debit transactions as these prices are so discounted.  If a credit or debit card is used a 5% mark-up will be added onto the total.</li>
</ul>
