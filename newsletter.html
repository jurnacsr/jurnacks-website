          <p>
            A number of years ago I put out a newsletter called Jurnack's, Naturally! News and thought it would be a good idea to get it going again!  So, periodically I will work on getting information  
            regarding natural foods/healing, nutrition, foods and more out to you.  I just may throw in a joke here or there!  I hope you find these newsletters helpful in your quest for better health, naturally!
          </p>

          <p>I am reading a couple books right now and have really started focusing on one in particular, "Nourishing Broth" by Sally Fallon Morrel and Kaayla T. Daniel.  These two women really go into great detail as to what is naturally occurring in bone broth (made from chicken, turkey, beef, venison, etc).  Collagen, which is needed just about everywhere in the body is abundant in homemade broth.  The different types of collagen include Type I whish is found abundantly in skin, tendons, ligaments, internal organs, bones, and the vascular system.  Type II which is the cartilage builder, and occurs in the cornea and vitreous humour of the eye.  Type III collagen teams up with Type I to keep the walls of our arteries and other hollow organs strong and supple.  Type IV ensures the health of cell basement membranes and the filtration system of capillaries.  And Type V is needed for the surfaces of cells, healthy hair, and the placenta during pregnancy.

          WOW, is collagen useful or what???!!!  And, to think it is easily consumed by drinking a few cups of homemade bone broth daily!!  Talk about easy!!!
          A...N...D...for those that just won't make the broth you can always use the Collagen Hydrolysate that we carry from Great Lakes.  It mixes in warm liquids better than cold but just fine in cold and has a very mild flavor.  So, if you need support for joint pain, body aches and general overall health consider adding collagen to your diet!

            Bone broth joke:
              A man walks into a restaurant and says, "How do you prepare your chickens?" The cook says, "Nothing special. We just  tell 'em they're gonna die."

                  I would be remiss if I didn't mention how the broth so positively affects intestinal/gut health.   For those that suffer with any type of mood or behavior issue the broth would be an ideal food to add to the diet.  One of the other books I'm reading is "The Second Brain" A Groundbreaking New Understanding of Nervous Disorders of the Stomach and Intestines by Michael Gershon.  From the Preface:  There are more than one hundred million nerve cells in the human small intestine, a number roughly equal to the number of nerve cells in the spinal cord.  Add on the nerve cells of the esophagus, stomach and large intestine and you find that we have more nerve cells in our bowel than in our spine.  The enteric nervous system is also a vast chemical warehouse within which is represented every one of the classes of neurotransmitters found in the brain.  Neurotransmitters are the words the nerve cells use for communicating with one another and with the cells under their control.

                <p><strong>What does that mean???</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Well it means that if the gut tube, which basically goes from the mouth all the way through to the end, is not balanced then the brain in the head really isn't balanced.  And, this can manifest in such issues as anxiety, depression, lack of attention, autism spectrum behavior and more!    This is why it is so important to make sure you're supporting the good, friendly bacteria, and there are many ways to do that.  Ever hear of Kim Chi, kefir, lacto-fermented vegetables or good old yogurt?  ALL these assist in balancing the microbiome .  Even neuroscientists are understanding the connection!
