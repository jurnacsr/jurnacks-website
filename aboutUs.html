        <center><strong><div class="aboutUs_special">The Birth of a Health Food Store</div></strong></center>
        </p><p>In
        1983, Mary Theresa's mother, Sally Schultz, opened Schultz's Natural
        Foods in resonse to her need for natural, unprocessed foods and
        supplements. Sally, a registered nurse, had been educating herself in
        what her body needed naturally to allow it to overcome the diagnosis of
        Lupus she had been given years ago. Sally knew that there were more
        people that would also benefit from her knowledge, so one thing led to
        another and the health food store became a reality.</p><p>In 1992 Mary
        Theresa and Dave took over the store and changed the name to Jurnack's,
        Naturally! Since then Mary Theresa has attended many lectures, classes
        and schools and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Holistic
        Nutrition. She is also a certified herbalist as well as a Master of
        Holisted Health and Certified Natural Health Professional.</p><p>Dave
        and Mary Theresa really do enjoy working together in the store offering
        you all you need to assist your body in doing what it was designed to
        do....heal itself!</p>
        <p>
        In September of 2013 Mary Theresa received her Doctor of Naturopathy diploma and is now a Traditional Doctor of Naturopathy and a member of The Pennsylvania Traditional Naturopaths Association.

        <center><strong><div class="aboutUs_special">What is Traditional Naturopathy?</div></strong></center></center>
        
        <p>"Naturopathy is a philosophy which encompasses a view of life, a model for living a full life. The word naturopathy is a Latin-Greek hybrid which can be defined as 'being close to or benefiting from nature.'" - Stewart Mitchell, Naturopathy: Understanding the Healing Power of Nature.</p>

        <p>A traditional, classical naturopath specializes in wellness. That is to say, teaching clients how applying natural lifestyle approaches can act to facilitate the body's own natural healing and health building potential. The traditional naturopath does not undertake to "diagnose" or "treat diseases," but rather recognizes that the majority of sub-health conditions are cumulative lifestyle effects, and that the underlying cause of what we call "disease" (or, "dis-ease") is improper diet, unhealthy habits, and environmental factors which cause biological imbalances leading to a weakening of the bodies' natural defenses and subsequent breakdown in health.</p>

        <p>Traditional Naturopaths guide and teach their client in natural health approaches such as fasting and detoxification, dietary improvements, the use of herbs, hot baths, aromatherapy, exercise, rest, sunshine, and many other natural health modalities.</p>

        <p>The practice of Traditional Naturopathy is not considered the practice of medicine and is currently legal in all 50 states, except South Carolina and Tennessee. </p>

        <p>The practice of Traditional Naturopathy is recognized as a common occupation at the Federal level (U.S. Congress 1928, 1929, 1930 and 30 Federal Court rulings between 1958 and 1978) and as such  it is a profession protected under the 14th and 9th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Several states have also made this stipulation either by statute or in the Courts.
